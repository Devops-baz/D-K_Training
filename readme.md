Hint: Fork --> PR 

Note:
Questions are well defined, please assume if you thing anything is missing 


Here are three questions to evaluate the candidate's skills in Linux, networking, and GitHub:

## Linux
1. A Linux system administrator wants to ensure that a specific service starts automatically after a system reboot. How to achieve this?

## Networking
2. What is the primary purpose of the tcpdump command, and how would you use it to capture traffic on a specific network interface (e.g., eth0)?

## GitHub
3. A developer wants to clone a GitHub repository and switch to a specific branch (e.g., feature/new-feature). What Git commands would they use to achieve this?
<br>

(Optional)
Question: What is the difference between a Docker container and a Kubernetes pod?

These questions will give us an idea of the candidate's Linux, networking, and GitHub skills, as well as their understanding of Docker and KubernetesÂ concepts.
